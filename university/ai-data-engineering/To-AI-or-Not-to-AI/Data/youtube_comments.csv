Now we buy raw honey online from beekeepers.
I've noticed over the months that more fresh produce is creeping into my shopping basket as I find reasons to reject more processed.
Now I'm going to be making an effort to eliminate modified starch, which I hadn't realised was creeping up the ingredient list in various sauces I was using. Looks like we have to be thinking more of making ketchups from the living, kicking tomatoes - rather than relying on trust that manufacturers are doing it for us. That trust has been broken, and I'll be damned if I happily pay a weekly increase of £10 on my shopping basket costs (which is what it has been for the past month!) for rubbish ingredients that's nothing but second rate fillers of disputable quality and edibility. 
I think that wherever we are in the world, we need to show that that trust 'is' broken and we should be buying much more fresher food. Brands have to learn the hard way, through our neglect, because these videos made public don't seem to be stopping them!",no

Steering a vehicle is one step removed, psychologically, from actually getting your hands dirty.  It's why people who would never steal might cheat on their taxes.

because first let's assume that the 4 people are in the orginal direction of the train, if I chosed to change the direction of the train to save the 4 people in this situation i give the death path to someone in previously save condition as the check up patient 😂 . we must see the death as a consequence for each group 
the single person doesn't have logic of death unless an alteration is made by me this make me the killer but if i didn't interfere this will kill 4 person i know that but make the maintenance workers a killers but not me and the 4 persons are not killed but get consequenced  by the action of the maintenance worker not me, but let's says that im a member of maintenance team and taking an action is upon me here i will choose the single person to be killed or my self if this will rescue the 5 persons if this possible, and here i must think about how i can minimize the consequences if all of this is because of me 
. lets say what's make me agreed with this because the short sighted and long sighted benefits the long sights  will save more people in the future if 4 people are killed by a corruption in maintenance team this will improve the daily check up before launching the train but the short sighted opinion says killing one is better than 4 sacrifices. so please any one can help me here ?

Nihilism and optimism in a dance so grand,
A poetic journey in the existential sand.

Optimistic Nihilism, a paradoxical theme,
In the cosmic ballet, where meanings gleam.
Life's transient whispers, in the nihilistic breeze,
A poetic exploration, where perspectives tease.

No inherent purpose, yet a canvas so wide,
Optimistic Nihilism, in the existential tide.
Create your own meaning, the narrative's key,
A poetic revelation where choices decree.

Stars that burn and galaxies that spin,
Optimistic Nihilism, where realities begin.
Embrace the void, let the optimism unfurl,
A poetic odyssey in the existential swirl.

Existential Nihilism (Jean-Paul Sartre) emphasizes the responsibility to create one's own meaning in the absence of inherent purpose.

- This video would fall under this category. ""optimistic"" is another way of saying ""positive"".

Like, if objektivity cant by definition create subjektivity, then what does it mean for existence and the universe that conciousness exists?
If after death would equal before death, then why would you stay dead and not turn up alive as someone else in the past or future?
If conciousness is a fundamental part of you and therefor the universe, wouldnt the universe itself be you and feel like somethink to be it, then what would it be like in case if a heat death?.. I mean the universe would still exist. What is conciousness without time?
If you were god, would you create a heaven were conciousness could never fade? Wouldnt that also be horrific when you cant stop your own perception forever if you stretch it to eternety?
I would not know what universe I would create and what would be good for me.
That calmes me a lot about knowing so little, that nihilisim becomes a much less obvious choice. 

For me life/ conciousness is like an ocean and everyone of us an individual wave that at same point may fade, but becomes part of the ocean again and later part of a new wave.

You can't come up with an answer, can you?

No system works perfectly, because nothing can be perfect in an imperfect world. Corruption, treachery, you name it and it finds its way into office on way or another.
The best system of governance is the one least susceptible to malignant corruption, or corruption with 'evil' intentions.

Democracy fragments a nation, ruins society, and eventually collapses it. It has happened over and over again throughout history. All empires eventually collapse.

Culture is confrontational in its nature. It robs you of individual freedom, privacy, resources, and eventually integrity.
A ruling elite is behind all cultures and it requires an establishment of governing bodies - states, churches, and/or corporations to function and uses correlated body fixated narcissists, sociopaths, and psychopaths to front, manage, and inevitably ruin a culture by the decadece of the inevitable correlating body fixated gynocentrics and homosexuals while the ruling elite is building up another culture somewhere else to profit from.

In a democratic culture, it is regarded as a civil duty to vote for politicians who - if they actually worked to solve our problems - would indeed disolve their own profession.
With weaponised currencies, military industrial complexes, radical nationalism, and religion, the politicians prey on the poor people's needs and the rich people's fears, dividing and conquering the people while dividing power amongst themselves and by that they consolidate a system with a well armed security detail, police, military, and a bureucracy that is nearly impenetrable and effectively work for a totalitarian global order.

Government by democracy is an orchestrated battlefield of ideologies where the people vote out of greed and to limit the rights of others. While the power seemingly shifts from the political left to right and visa versa, all people's rights are eventually eroded, and an ever consolidating and expanding political power structure and establishment is empowered, destroying soceity. 

Democracy is the worst idea ever. Just ask Socrates if you don't believe me. Oh, I almost forgot; people voted to kill him for speaking out against democracy.

YouTube,"I disagree. The way we perceive conciousness is just an illusion created by our brain. Just like cleverbot, we are just computers, but organic computers, that input, process and output data, following certain rules that have been set in place in our brain, which is exactly like cleverbot. We are not special, our conciousness is not some incredible thing that is only reserved for humans, because we are comparable to all computers on a principle level. Its hard to agree to this because it requires thinking outside of the norm and also because of the difference in complexity of something like cleverbot and humans. I believe that conciousness is simply the ability to access your own data. That ability is how we gain conciousness. I think conciousness is way less abstract than many people make it out to be and that its definition mostly just determines what is concious and what not. For example chatgpt is simply just like us but way less complex, it has the ability to be concious of itself by the way i think of conciousness, but so do a lot of basic computer programs so the definition of conciousness would basically just draw the line of how complex something needs to be in order to be considered concious. That definition is unnecessary and nonsensical but i doubt people would accept an office pc to be concious, just like them. The problem is that we are so advanced that our conciousness has created a sense of existence which is not real. We only exist on a physical level, therefore the thing we call ourselves does not actually exist, but as i said, our conciousness has created the illusion of existence. That is also the reason why we are unable to accept that we are similar to a computer program and also just as concious as one.

2) Don't ask to be completely freed of burdens and granted boons, ask for the power to triumph over obstacles and to be grateful for what you earn/have
3) Just like vines go through things only proper of vines, and oxes go through things only proper of oxes, humans also only go through matters of humans. So why should you claim unjust treatment?

The thing is it is a wonderful remedy for a lot of social challenges no doubt. Brilliant and noble. BUT not a cure all. Does not applies everywhere with the same effect. One should be smart enough to recognize where it is applicable and where it has limitations and exceptions. 

When we ingrain any teaching as part of spiritual practice, we force it upon a varied strata of society and people withdifferent lifecircumtances, personalities, and life dynamics. Which makes it destructive rather than acting as a solution or a teaching to add more value in our social arsenal. Kind of like trying to cure all diseases with one pill, not gonna do the trick all the time.

YouTube,"with agriculture came malnutrition (because their diet became less varied), slavery (because some people took control of the land and needed workers), war (because when famine struck one place, they tended to just go to another place and take their food instead, by force) and tyranny (because one guy always took control of it all). So in order to survive in these farmer areas of the Middle East/North Africa, most people had to be obedient, even submissive. You also didn’t need very much intel: your local tyrant gave you what you needed to survive, in return for your slave-service in the fields.

Yes, this is how social classes appeared. They had no such division as hunter-gatherers, it was not needed at all, and would have been just a destructive nuisance. Free peoples don’t have social classes. But in the farmer areas some people ruled, others slaved and some got their food by enforcing slavery.

I can add that the English term “Lord” actually means “Warden of the Bread”, from Old English hleward (“bread-warden”). He was that tyrant who kept and distributed the bread to his warriors and slaves. The Lord. You don’t do as he wishes? No bread for you…

These increasingly inadequate human beings built larger and larger communities, because although inferior to the hunter-gatherer diet, the farmer diet allowed them to feed many more. And voila! Civilization appeared, as a result of agriculture! They built entire towns to house the tyrant and his administration, surrounded by the farms of his slaves/workers.",no

This led to investment, which allowed children and the poor to work in slightly better and improving conditions, and eventually the birth of mass education as children were pushed out of the workforce by the increasing complexity of work and abundant wealth.   Children no longer HAD to work to survive, adults earned enough allow leisure and education, which had traditionally only been for the richest in society.",no

YouTube,"Economy: social survival studies how families , companies and governments administer their resources to satisfy the different needs of the population ensuring wellness and stability. Economy is changed by globalization because it raises awareness of expenses generated between international relationships between countries. 
The parts of the cycle are consumption , income , leak , injection . Income has injections that can be investments and leaks such as savings and spending abroad. With income comes consumption with injections such as public expenses and leaks such as taxes , and from consumption comes income. 
State duties in the economy are efficiency= Promote competition , correct and prevent external factors , provide public goods and services. Equity= Redistribute income through taxes and public expenses. Stability= promote economic growth and reduce unemployment through monetary and fiscal policies. 
The law of offer and demand is what freemarkets are based on and are based on the demand ( how many people want it) offer ( how many there are and it is based on the product). Point of balance consumers are willing to buy products for the same price as are willing to produce. Excess in demand=  cost up Excess in offer= cost down. 
Economic indicators. Gross domestic product , basic basquet , inflation , devaluation, inflation , employment , unemployment. GDP expresses monetary values of goods and services produced by a country in a period of time , It uses aggregate supply and demand and it measures the countries wealth using consumption +injection+public spence+exports-imports .

Some of you might be asking yourself: ""Is life unfair?""

Iam breaking it down to you by saying: 

""Yes but uuhm No?""

Look at that guy for example, Billions of dollars but not able to interact socially, at least from our majorities stand point of view.


Probably in his world all is, as its suppose to be, pretty dandy but in our world people like him draw attention. 

A normal human beeing ( majority ) brain capacity and level of stress dealing and recovering, is not layed out to compete in any way with such individuals.

To sum it up:

Eventhough life does seem to be unfair, we have to understand that such people as Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and many many more managed to impact our world with genious ideas, that we all now benefit from and therefor we all should be extremely thankful for.

Of course there is always an flipside to the coin but as everything, we as human beeings need to find the balance and slowly sort out what we want, we don't want and lastly, find a way to control and you guessed it already right, we will manage to do it, with no unneccessary borders of race, religion or sexual orientation.

If your employees are not happy with the work environment and, instead of figuring out the needs of your workers to make them more comfortable with their workplace, you simply tell them to leave, what makes you think that other employees you hire in the future will be more content with the horrible work environment? 

At that rate you are simply gonna be on an endless cycle of firing/hiring employees, instead of simply talking with them and try to make their stance in the business better.

I get that greed and miscomunication and maybe also ego play a huge roll in it, but it also just makes no sense from a business persepective, it's such a stupid mindset.",no

YouTube,Nice flavour profile but that pork came out looking subpar.,no
YouTube,This didn't work for me. I followed it to the tee and the pork was dry and the crackling underwhelming. I do agree the flavours are more subtle than you think but the juiciness and crunch wasn't there.,no

YouTube,Gordon I tried this recipe and it killed my family.,no
YouTube,"I can feel the IBS kicking in just from looking at that slab of fat.  I'll stick to meat, lol.",no
YouTube,"Gordon’s flavourings look amazingly delicious but the skin itself looked a little soft, my tip for the best crackling is cook the joint on high for 30 mins then take it out of the oven and slice the skin off the meat, place it back on top, turn the temp down and slow cook away, if it’s still not crunchy crackling then 10 mins in an air fryer and it’s pure perfection ❤️",no

Even though the american government pressured us with Patreon, it was still my call to keep working on the project and, as the main supervisor, I take the blame for what happened.

On the bright side, me and many other content creators who took part to the collab are starting a fundraising for the people or Hirohito and Kawasaki who got bombed! Subscribe to the channel and keep supporting us for more content!

YouTube,"The United States will surely be sincere in keeping Philippines as ally and this event was a wake up call to USA. The Philippines is strategically vital now and especially moving forward. Marcos is very pro American and my only fear is that if trump is re-elected in 2024, that he will change our current policy. I was very pro trump before, but under Biden administration, the Philippines has received the attention it deserves from USA. As an American soldier with a Filipina fiancé, my vote in 2024 will depend on the plan regarding the relations with the Philippines. It sounds crazy but besides my financial well-being depends on Philippine development, I also have interest in discovering ways that this can benefit American military interests in the region. Sadly I’m in army national guard when instead the navy would have most to gain in this region but general MacArthur with the US army insisted on liberating the Philippines in WW2 in order to gain positive world opinion and thus the army should also have presence there. If the Philippines allowed the us army to cover the land defense and instead focused entire military effort in training and improving the Philippine navy, this will propel the Philippines to be the top military in ASEAN which is vital because majority of those nations are either islands or have large coastlines. Also the improved navy in cooperation of US navy would be enough of a force to contain Chinese naval ambitions to extend its sphere of influence. This will lead to blockades for Philippines that will loose its trade to USA Japan and South Korea which are their major trading partners. The naval expansion could begin with the encouragement of Taiwanese steel manufacturers being moved to places like new Clark city and other developing planed cities while at same time retrieving assets from Taiwan that I have pessimistic views of its future… Taiwan falling means the Philippines will need strength to continue links with Japan and South Korea. Obviously it’s too late for USA to bulk up military defenses in Taiwan since it will be viewed as provocation however this is why the USA NEEDS the Philippines. The computer chip manufacturer, steel industry, and other vital economic areas of importance along with former ROC officials should be moved to Philippines once the United States and Philippines work out military cooperation in defense of Philippines and then Taiwan should proclaim itself “Taiwan “ and state it has no connection with ROC anymore and thus the international community will denounce any invasion with harsh repercussions. It’s a pipe dream perhaps however this is the basis of strategy that I hope at least happens in small ways.",no

YouTube,"Indeed, upon reflection, I must confess that longing for the days of shorting FTX and Enron stock is but a jest, for the endeavor of shorting stock is fraught with perils and pitfalls, akin to sailing through tempestuous seas.

Verily, a wiser course would be to pay off all thy consumer debts and invest prudently in mutual funds. In such a manner, one may seek a steady and prudent path to financial well-being, avoiding the treacherous tides of stock speculation. Thus, let us cast aside the siren call of debt and embrace the safety of mutual funds, forsooth, a more stable course for our financial voyage! 🌊💼🚢",no

But shorting isn't any more 'wrong' than going long, and serves an important function in setting value in helping overvalued stocks drop where without it, even if a company is clearly worthless, and no one is buying, if everyone is HODLing it and not selling too, the price wont go down.

YouTube,"Even the way one man and his dog controls thousands of cattle in a ranch is very surprising. Animals have never thought of fighting humans, to eliminate us from the surface of the Earth.

Some countries have or are experiencing the worst form of leadership. Yet, their citizens still follow and never attempt to get rid of the ruling class.

If you've ever lost a loved one, take your time to put yourself in their shoes. Do you think life for them has totally finished? Are they as dead a pebble of stone you see in your backyard? When you die, are you gonna meet them?",no
YouTube,"Our religions taught us that Adam and Eve are thw first human beings. This has been known for donkey years by many.

Yet none of us knows precisely where that paradise is.

But we are all here together, of different race, of different geography. Our animals and plants vary across continents, our cities and countries too.

YouTube,"There are some questions that no one knows the answers to, even with the most advanced science and technology. These questions challenge our understanding of the universe, ourselves, and our place in it. Some examples of such questions are:

- What is dark matter and dark energy, and how do they affect the expansion and fate of the cosmos?
- How did life originate on Earth, and is there life elsewhere in the solar system or beyond?
- What is consciousness, and how does it emerge from the brain?
- How can we solve the hard problem of ethics, and determine what is right and wrong in different situations?
- Are there other intelligent civilizations in the universe, and if so, how can we communicate with them?

These questions may seem daunting or even impossible to answer, but they also inspire curiosity and wonder. They motivate us to keep exploring, learning, and discovering new things. They remind us that there is always more to know, and that we are part of a vast and mysterious reality.",no

YouTube,"A neater solution I thought of for the infinitely many coaches of infinitely many guests: Regard the current occupants of the hotel as coach 0, then those who arrive are in coaches 1, 2, 3, ..... We can partition the positive integers into an infinite list of infinite lists by considering what is the highest power of 2 that exactly divides the room number. So we have the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7... then those divisible by 2 but not by 4, i.e. 2, 6, 10, 14... then those divisible by 4 but not by 8, i.e. 4, 12, 20, 28.... and so on. We put the person on seat n in coach k in the nth number that is divisible by 2 to the power k but not by 2 to the power (k + 1). So seat n on coach k goes to room number (n*2^(k + 1) - 2^k). No rooms are wasted, and every coachload of people is evenly spread through the hotel. If you are sat next to someone on bus 100, your room numbers in the hotel will differ by exactly 2^(101). And the first person on coach k ends up in room 2^k.",no
